* Definitions



* Users _expect_ to be notified on events.

  - Scene: Tom logs into app X and asks a question on a post Carl made, but Carl
    is not logged in.  4H later, Carl logs in, and, greatness, a +1 is here
    begging him to check the question Tom asked him.

  - Attempted approaches: null

  - Interfering factors: null



* Sufficient solution's conditions

  - (sat c75b) Carl should receive notifications whenever an object he is tracking changes in his back.
